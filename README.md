## Overview

Welcome to the Master The Legacy Project! In this collaborative effort, two enthusiastic colleagues come together to tackle the challenge of transforming a dated legacy infrastructure into a cutting-edge next-generation environment. This project is designed not only to learn and practice new technologies but also to apply best practices in the field of DevOps, Cloud Engineering, and Site Reliability Engineering.


### Branch strategy

#### Release flow

- Base branch: `main`
- Feature branch: `feature/*`
- Fix branch: `fix/*`
- Chore branch: `chore/*`

1. For a new feature:
- Create a new branch from `main` to `feature/<feature-name>` `git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>`
- Once the feature is complete and tested, a new PR should be created to merge back to `main` `gh pr create`

2. For bug fix:
- Create a new branch from `main` to `fix/<fix-name>` `git checkout -b fix/<fix-name>`
- After the fix is implemented and tested, a new PR should be created to merge back to `main` `gh pr create`

3. For chore:
- Create a new branch from `main` to `chore/<chore-name>` `git checkout -b chore/<chore-name>`
- After the chore is implemented and tested, a new PR should be created to merge back to `main` `gh pr create`

### Infrastructure

![infra](./images/eks_infra.png)

#### Create new bucket for terraform state
```bash
aws s3api create-bucket --region us-east-1 --bucket master-the-legacy-tf-state --acl private
```

#### Scaffold development workflow

This repository contains a scaffold development workflow that comments the terraform plan to a Pull request whenever a new one is opened.

Also it applies the infrastructure from scaffold folder once merged to `main`.

> Note: The workspace/environment is hard coded as `dev`. TODO: figure out a way to promote across environments, should we plan/apply to all workspaces at once ? (we can use matrix to that)

#### Scaffold dispatch workflow

This repository contains a scaffold workflow in order to easily create or destroy the environment through a dispatcher (**manually**).

To scaffold the desired environment, select the environment (dev, staging and prod) and the create option (default one). You can also select `plan-only` to plan only or `destroy` to destroy all resources in the desired environment.

There is also a `vanish` workflow that destroy all the workspaces/environments at the determined schedule configuration.

#### Local terraform

To plan apply using locally terraform follow the basic terraform workflow, example:

```bash
# For any modification, always format
terraform fmt

# Init
terraform init

# Validate the code
terraform validate

# Select the desired workspace
terraform workspace select <environment>

# Plan
terraform plan -out plan.out # TBD, in order to differ environments --var-file=<env>.tfvars. Is there a way we can use terraform.workspace to do more complex logic ?

# Apply
terraform apply plan.out # TBD, --var-file=<env>.tfvars
```

### EKS

#### Connecting to the cluster

Configuring kubernetes context
```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name "<env>-master-cluster"
```

To test connection `kubectl get svc`
